"""MeetStream REST client: find a bot's recording and pull its transcript and media.

In MeetStream, a "bot" is one meeting session: it joins a Zoom, Google Meet or Teams call,
records it, and (if configured) transcribes it. A bot id therefore identifies a recording.

This client covers the read-only operations that MeetStream's MCP server exposes as tools
(`list_bots`, `get_bot_detail`, `get_transcript`, `get_media_urls`). We call them over REST
rather than through an LLM + MCP so downloads and timestamps stay exact and testable.

API reference: https://docs.meetstream.ai/api-reference/introduction

Behaviour worth knowing:
  * Auth is `Authorization: Token <key>` (the literal word "Token", not "Bearer").
  * Media and transcript endpoints return HTTP 202 while the bot is still in the meeting or
    post-call processing is running. That is not an error; poll again (see
    `with_retry_when_processing`).
  * Media endpoints return *presigned S3 URLs* that expire after about an hour, so we
    download immediately instead of storing the URL.
